# DSAcauseDSA
DSA libraries built when bored. Are they efficient in space or time? Possibly in one. Probably not in both. 


### Note:
If you are looking at this and thinking to yourself, "dang, all these commit dates are really close together. Did this guy really throw this repo together just to have something to point interviewers to?"
Firstly, yes, I did lose all my random libraries I made when I got bored or felt out of practice because I used local version control and can no longer find the physical medium they reside on.
Secondly, yes I did throw this together so interviewers could C if I am any kind of skilled at this programming thing.
